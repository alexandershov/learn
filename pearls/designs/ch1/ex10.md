1. Bicycle. Tour-de-france caliber cyclist can do 21-25 mph on a mountain
   terrain. Let's take a 20-place of Tour-de-france, the prize on Tour-de-france for him
   is 1000$ for 22 days. Which means 50 dollars a day. We can give him
   a 60 dollars a day. So - saving money. Not saving time.
2. Pigeons. Let's say 60 mph. Almost free (we're not talking about
   world class racing pigeons here). We can get a lot of them and
   do more 
3. Motor bicycle. Probably 30 minutes (no jams). Probably 2 times cheaper.
4. Helicopter. 200$ per hour. And pilot who is really expensive. Out
   regardless of 100mph.
5. Modem - about 1kbit in 1986. Let's say drawings are 1000kbit. 
   about 20 minutes, kinda free.
6. Fax - 4.8kbit, kinda free. One page per minute - 12 minutes. 
   But low quality.
7. Some optical stuff (Lockheed was involved in Hubble - as transported only)
   but they could use these connections and get something. It's hard to
   estimate cost, but probably 25 miles is an unreasonable, and there're
   some mountains there, so this is out.
   
And the winner is: fax, modem, pigeons.
